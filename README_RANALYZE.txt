Notes:
				I have avoided automating image selection here, instead I took the simple route. I have included pre-selected samples. Feel free to make new ones following how I used the pre-packaged ones.
				
Usage:	
				C D   T O   S R C _ R A N A L Y Z E
					Edit in the selected sample from the top of the file.
					Rscript dispclassify.r
				
				C U S T O M
					Again, edit the top of the file to change to selection
